I think everyone is a little lost in this world. Over time, we have forgotten that symbols have meanings. 
We are not here to waste away behind a desk for the sake of GDP. We are here to find love and create a family. 
We are here to find a love so strong that it creates another person. We are here to share those experiences 
with our children, hoping they can experience it themselves. I don't know the conclusion of our story, but 
it's a beautiful story nonetheless.

### If it's always pointing towards you, you end up lost.
